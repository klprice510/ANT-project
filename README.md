# ANT-project
Code snippets from the ANT+ thesis project for MS Computer Science.

Dynastream Innovations developed a proprietary multi-cast network protocol called Advanced and Adaptive Network Technology (ANT).  This protocol has gained popularity for applications in the exercise industry.  Bicycle smart trainers can now use a prescribed workout and feedback communicated by ANT to precisely control resistance.

These files are code snippets that use the ANT protocol to control an eddy current braked bicycle trainer.
